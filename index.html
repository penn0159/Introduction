<p> My name is Kristian Penny, I'm a Musician and video editor, I do work for my local church in both fields. I grew up in a country called Grenada and move to Canada at the age
    of 10 with my two brothers, and parents. Since the age of 10 I've always wanted to play music skillfully, I currently play the drums, guitar and bass guitar. I love graphics, animating texts
and editing videos, eventually I would love to create music videos. I make random youtube videos with my friends, and the whole reason I started that little youtube channel was to get
better at using editing softwares   </p>
